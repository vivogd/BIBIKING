<h1>Thank you for purchasing this card swipe asset!</h1>
<p>This readme is intended to help you get started with this asset, but if anything is missing or you have any suggestions/questions. Please feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:redpanther1990@gmail.com">redpanther1990@gmail.com</a></p>
<br>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>There is an example scene called CardSwipeExampleScene that has the project setup for a reference on how this asset functions.</p>
<br>

<h2>To get started</h2>
<h3>Create cards</h3>
<p>I've created the cards as scriptable objects, which means they can be created from a menu item by right clicking in the project location, go to <b>Create</b> > <b>Card</b> > <b>New Card</b></p>
<p><i><small>You may also create the cards programmatically if you prefer.</small></i></p>
<p>Give the Card a name (in the example project above they have been named after food) and then assign the card's Image field to a Sprite</p>
<br>
<h3>Create your own Swipe Manager</h3>
<p>You'll want to create your own Swipe Manager that is responsible for holding all of the cards, and handling if a card was liked, disliked, or if the user has finished the entire deck of cards. You can copy from the existing SwipeManager.cs that is provided.</p>
<p>In the example provided, the SwipeManager is attached to the parent Canvas. Cards are added to the allCards list.</p>
